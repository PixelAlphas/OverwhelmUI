## Project Overwhelm.
Overwhelm UI is essentially custom MCBE UI, better known as JSON-UI.
This features cleans UI for small devices and large devices, with controller supports and customization friendly.
This UI is developed on the phone. no any PC assistants etc. just, phone.

It's pretty at alpha stage, so everything may subjects to change and may not represent final release until beta stage.

## What's in it?
( Like I said, alpha stage. )
* Configuration System.
* Controls support (not implemented yet)
* Better interface and visuals
* Customizable and shareable configuration contents.
* Low-End support

## Progress
* Start Screen ~ 100% (for now)
* Play Screen ~ 80% (Featuted Servers/internal Servers are WIP)
* Setting Screen - 0%
* Gameplay/Hud Screen - 0%

## Goal of this
* Adds massive customization so people can create their own theme and able to share.
* Improving its Vanilla UI Optimization to work massively better with low-end devices.
* User friendly, Clean UI and better options
* Able to select and disable elements in hud screen, and few additional features
* Developers friendly, allowing dev's to fork this UI and able to create their own with simplest code to begin with.
* Texture pack developers friendly, providing any resources to be changed and thus may use "Java Edition" as resources source.

## Be warned.
It's not really "beta" or "stable" releases, expect some issues like lagging issues, and horrible optimization.
so don't expect high quality stability lol
